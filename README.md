# taskinator
Use this website to keep track of your to-do list.

## description

Taskinator lets you add to-do items to your to-do list.  From there, you can edit them, or delete them completely. Once you make progress on them, you can change their status to "in progress" or "completed" via a drop-down menu, or drag and drop.  

## building

This was a fun way to learn the drag-and-drop features of Javascript. It also helped me see how to move created elements around a page using "appendChild."  I was also introduced to localStorage, so I could store the to-do items so that they'd reload with the page.  This way, the user doesn't have to re-create their to-do list every time they leave the page. 

I'm very happy with the result, and would use this page myself to keep track of my tasks. The only glitch I'm still working through is getting the to-do items to reload in the correct columns.  They all reload, but they just reload to the to-do section, even if they were completed or in-progress. This could be extremely annoying, especially for users with a lot of tasks.
